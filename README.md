```css
.equi-image {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

- Mobile responsiveness
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/resize-image-proportionally-with-css/) - This helped me for resizing the image. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
